# MyCentOS_config
Just a small script that does initial setup of things I find useful for CentOS:  
  1. Adds debian-like color prompt (thank you to kholis for the script he hosts, just pulls that into /etc/profile.d)
  2. Enables CentOS Plus and PowerTools repos, (if on Stream, enables that one as well)
  3. Installs EPEL
  4. Installs ELRepo and enables Extras
  5. Requires root password for sudoers
  6. Enables smooth scrolling and constantshow in nano
