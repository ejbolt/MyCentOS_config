# MyCentOS_config
Just a small script that does initial setup of things I find useful for CentOS:  
  Adds debian-like color prompt (thank you to kholis for the script he hosts, just pulls that into /etc/profile.d)
  Enables CentOS Plus and PowerTools repos, (if on Stream, enables that one as well)
  Installs EPEL
  Installs ELRepo
  Requires root password for sudoers
